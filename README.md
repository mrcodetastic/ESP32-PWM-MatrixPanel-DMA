## 78 x 78 pixel eWaste LED PWM Based Panel

Uses PWM based chip that takes 16 bits sent in a series for every pixel in the relevant chain.

There are 12 channels, as the panel is broken into 4 x RGB sections for each 1/4 of the panel (20 pixel in height each, for a total of 80px of which only 78 physical pixels exist).

The code compensates for the 2 'ghost' pixels.

## Software and Hardware implementation(s)
There are two hardware implementations for this LED panel, as one implementation isn't enough for me. As these two Espressif MCUâ€™s have different capabilities and constraints, the software implementations are different. 

tl/dr - The ESP32-S3 is the best device to use of the two implementations. However, the ESP32-S2 is super cheap to buy and does the job depending on your needs.
